## custom docker images
[tootsuite/mastodon:`...`-yai](https://github.com/Lori3f6/mastodon): with toot limitations change and custom theme addons. Can also be replaced into original `tootsuite/mastodon` in `mastodon/docker-compose.yml`

## folders and permissions
Still changing

## networks
All networks(`mastodon-internal`,`matrix-internal`) need to be created before executing `docker compose up` to make different composer object sharing network easier
